Mother 3 (english version v1.3) soft reset detection:

- The game doesn't clear the first 8 bytes of IWRAM on boot
- The game checks for the ASCII string "M3 GBSON" and sets runtime 0 if present
- The game plants this value there on soft reset
- The game thus knows if it's a cold or warm boot via runtime flag 0
- This seems to be unused
